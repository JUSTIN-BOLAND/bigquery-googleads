# Google Ads <-> BigQuery

Standard SQL Query to join the various Google Ads tables (generated by the Google Ads Data Transfer) into a meaningful View on Adgroup level

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Account (with enabled Billing - you get min $250 starting balance which should be enough for a few months)
- Google BigQuery Project
- Google Ads Data Transfer: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/adwords-transfer

### Run the query

- Once the Google Ads Data Transfer is complete, navigate to the newly created tables and open the Query Editor
- Change the SQL settings to "Standard"
- Paste the desired Query from this repository into the editor
- Replace ```XXXXXXXXXX``` with the ID of your Google Ads MCC account
- Replace ```BQPROJECTNAME.TABLENAME``` with the Project ID & Table which contains the dataset in your BQ account
- Run the Query and check the data

### Fetch data from Looker/Domo/Power BI/Tableau

- Looker and Domo both have inbuilt BigQuery connectors, so you can just use the same query from these tools. For the rest, i will update documentation here shortly
